I am a highly motivated graduate with a strong academic background in Physics and Mathematics from Queen Mary, University of London. My experience in data analysis and programming has equipped me with the skills necessary to thrive in dynamic and analytical roles.

Throughout my academic journey, I have developed strong problem-solving and analytical abilities. My final year project involved obtaining and statistically analysing data to explore factors affecting the QST device, resulting in a significant reduction in uncertainty and a breakthrough in its development. This experience honed my ability to tackle complex problems critically and methodically.

My passion for data analysis and programming was further developed during a data analytics bootcamp at Skills City Virtual. Here, I gained practical experience in data concepts, analysis techniques, data visualisation, and database management using tools such as Excel, Python, Power BI, Tableau and SQL. Additionally, I completed a virtual internship with Accenture, where I cleaned, modelled, and analysed datasets to uncover insights for strategic decision-making. This project enhanced my ability to derive meaningful conclusions and present them effectively to stakeholders.

As part of data analysis boot camp, I completed an extended project where I have to create a tool to estimate the costs of several cyber security solutions, that we had to research as a team, streamlining the process for providing accurate and efficient cost estimates for remediation solutions. The tool will feature a robust, continuously updated dataset, advanced search and filter functionalities, and an intuitive user interface compatible with platforms like Excel and Power BI. It will integrate with KPMG's Cyber Maturity Assessment (CMA) framework to guide data requirements and support remediation activities. Optional data visualisation capabilities will enhance reporting and client presentations. This project will improve efficiency, accuracy and client service in delivering cost estimates and remediation roadmaps. This also involved report writing, presenting, user guide writing and admin guide writing to give directions about how to update the tool.

Beyond my technical skills, I have cultivated excellent communication abilities through participation in team sports, group projects and tutoring roles. These experiences have underscored the importance of teamwork, leadership and effective interpersonal communication in achieving common goals. I am adept at conveying complex ideas clearly, facilitating productive discussions and enhancing teamwork.

I am enthusiastic about applying my analytical, detail-oriented and driven approach to roles that demand advanced data analysis and problem-solving capabilities. My goal is to leverage my skills to support data-driven decision-making and contribute to meaningful outcomes in a fast-paced, agile environment.

These are some of the projects I have completed in my spare time using python.
